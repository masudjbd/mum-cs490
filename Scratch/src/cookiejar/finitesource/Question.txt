The Finite-Source Cookie Jar Problem. A cookie jar is being shared by two sisters, Tina and Judy, using
the following rule: Judy can get a cookie from the jar only after Tina (being the older sister) gets a cookie in
at least two separate occasions, whereas Tina gets a cookie from the jar whenever she wants to. The mother
is alerted by Judy or Tina whenever they want to eat a cookie and the jar is empty, in which case the mother
fills the jar up (from a hidden source), and the kids go on eating. Treating Tina, Judy and the mother as three
independently executing processes and the Cookie Jar as a shared resource, develop a concurrent algorithm
to solve the Finite-Source Cookie Jar Problem.
